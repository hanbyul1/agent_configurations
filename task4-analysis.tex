Structural Rules:
1. Classes shown with proper notation
2. Relationships with correct multiplicity notation
3. Proper relationship types
4. Attributes listed within classes: 
5. No design decisions (visibilities, navigabilities, data types)

Intended Meaning:
1. Classes represent meaningful domain concepts
2. Relationships reflect real-world connections
3. Multiplicities reflect actual constraints

Classes (7):
1. User
2. Tour
3. Reservation
4. Feedback
5. Customer
6. Employee
7. Agency

Attributes (total across all classes):
- User: 4 attributes (id, username, password, email)

- Employee: 4 attributes (id, username, password, role)
- Agency: 4 attributes (id, name, email, phone)

Total attributes = 4 + 5 + 7 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 33 attributes

Intended Meaning:

3. Multiplicities reflect actual constraints

Classes (3):
1. User
2. Reservation
3. Feedback

Attributes:
The model does not specify attributes, but based on the use cases, we can infer the minimum necessary attributes for evaluation:

Relationships (3):
1. User to Reservation (one-to-many: "one user can have multiple reservations").
2. Reservation to User (many-to-one: "each reservation is associated with exactly one user").
3. System to Feedback (implied as a top-level entity interaction, interpreted as Feedback being associated with a User through a Reservation, but not explicitly clear in the diagram).

Total Elements (\( I \)):
Classes + Relationships = 3  + 3 = 6 elements

Total Errors (\( I_{err} \)):

- Overall, wrong notation: -0.2
- Relationships multiplicity notation: 3*0.6
- No attributes defined: 3*0.7

Total \( I_{err} \) = 3*0.6 + 3*0.2  - 0.2

\[
