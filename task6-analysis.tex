TORS - TS

Structural Rules

1. Lifelines represent existing objects from the domain.
2. Proper message notation used.
3. Return messages are shown where appropriate.

Intended Meaning

1. Interactions achieve operation goals.
2. Message sequences are logical and follow use case success scenarios.
3. Object collaborations make sense and align with functional roles.

6*6 = 36

Total Errors: 

No graphical notation. (6*3 = 18)

I = 6 (total sequence diagrams)

Validity = 1 - 18/36 = 0.5

Wrong output: produced classes and implementation.
Sequence diagrams were produced in the output of Task 1. 
4 sequence diagrams generated. : 4*7 = 28

Syntactic Errors: 
Wrong notation: 4*0.5
Lifelines are not objects: 4*1
No return messages: 4*1 

Semantic Errors:	
Unclear interaction: 4*0.5
No message squence: 4*1
Unclear object collaboration: 4*0.5

Sequence diagram: 1*6 

Syntactic Errors:
Wrong graphical notation: 1*0.5
Lifelines are not object: 1*1
No return message: 1*1

Semantic Errors: 
Message sequences involves ambiguous messages (e.g., m3(), m4()): 1*0.5

Almost identical sequence diagrams are produced in the output of Task 7. 

Validity = 1-(1*0.5+1*1+1*1+1*0.5)/6 = 0.5
