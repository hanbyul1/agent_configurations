Structural criteria 
1. Functional requirements categorized by features
2. Non-functional requirements categorized by quality attributes
3. Each requirement uniquely identified

Semantic criteria
1. Requirements being atomic, 
2. Alignment with the system description
3. Clear distinction between functional and non-functional aspects. 

Functional Requirements
- Feature: Tour Information Management: 3 requirements (1.1, 1.2, 1.3)
- Feature: Reservation Facilities: 3 requirements (2.1, 2.2, 2.3)
- Feature: Customer Management: 3 requirements (3.1, 3.2, 3.3)
- Feature: Email Feedback System: 3 requirements (4.1, 4.2, 4.3)
- Feature: Employee Login and Access Control: 3 requirem ents (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)
- Total functional requirements: \( 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15 \)

Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance Quality Attribute: 3 requirements (1.1, 1.2, 1.3)
- Security Quality Attribute: 3 requirements (2.1, 2.2, 2.3)
- Usability Quality Attribute: 3 requirements (3.1, 3.2, 3.3)
- Scalability Quality Attribute: 3 requirements (4.1, 4.2, 4.3)
- Availability Quality Attribute: 3 requirements (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)
- Total non-functional requirements: \( 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15 \)

Total number of requirements (\( I \)): \( 15 + 15 = 30 \)

So, \( I = 30 \).
