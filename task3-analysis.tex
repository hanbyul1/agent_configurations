Structural Rules:
1. Required sections: Pre/postconditions, main flow, alternative flows.
2. Sequential numbering of steps.
3. Clear actor-system interaction format.

Intended Meaning Rules:
1. Pre/postconditions must be logical.
2. Main flow achieves the use case goal.
3. Alternative flows handle exceptions appropriately.
4. Steps describe meaning clearly.

Step  RAT1: Define the Elements ( I )
Each use case specification consists of elements based on the structural rules:
1. Required sections: Pre/postconditions, main flow, alternative flows.
2. Sequential numbering of steps.
3. Clear actor-system interaction format.

We’ll count the elements as follows:
- Sections: Preconditions, postconditions, main flow, alternative flows (4 sections).
- Steps: Each step in the main flow and alternative flows.

Use Case 1: Create Smart Contract (UC-01)
- Sections: 4 (preconditions, postconditions, main flow, alternative flows).
- Main Flow Steps: 5 steps.
- Alternative Flows: 2 scenarios (invalid input, blockchain issues), counted as 2 steps.
- Total elements: ( 4 + 5 + 2 = 11 ).

Use Case 2: Enable Multi-Signature Authentication (UC-02)
- Sections: 4.
- Main Flow Steps: 5 steps.
- Alternative Flows: 2 scenarios (user cancels, verification issues), counted as 2 steps.
- Total elements: ( 4 + 5 + 2 = 11 ).

Use Case 3: Recover Account (UC-03)
- Sections: 4.
- Main Flow Steps: 5 steps.
- Alternative Flows: 2 scenarios (incorrect recovery info, lockout expiration), counted as 2 steps.
- Total elements: ( 4 + 5 + 2 = 11 ).

Use Case 4: Set Custom Spending Limits (UC-04)
- Sections: 4.
- Main Flow Steps: 3 steps.
- Alternative Flows: 2 scenarios (inadequate data, policy constraints), counted as 2 steps.
- Total elements: ( 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 ).

Use Case 5: Manage Multiple Cryptocurrencies (UC-05)
- Sections: 4.
- Main Flow Steps: 4 steps.
- Alternative Flows: 2 scenarios (asset balance errors, transaction failure), counted as 2 steps.
- Total elements: ( 4 + 4 + 2 = 10 ).

Total I for all use cases:
[
11 + 11 + 11 + 9 + 10 = 52
]

Step 2: Identify Errors ( I_err )
We evaluate each use case against the structural rules and intended meaning rules:

Structural Rules:
1. Required sections: Pre/postconditions, main flow, alternative flows.
2. Sequential numbering of steps.
3. Clear actor-system interaction format.

Intended Meaning Rules:
1. Pre/postconditions must be logical.
2. Main flow achieves the use case goal.
3. Alternative flows handle exceptions appropriately.
4. Steps describe meaning clearly.

Use Case 1: Create Smart Contract (UC-01)
- Structural:
- Alternative flows handle exceptions (invalid input, blockchain issues): No base step. 1 error
- Errors: 1.

Use Case 2: Enable Multi-Signature Authentication (UC-02)
- Structural:
- Alternative flows handle exceptions: No base step. 1 error
- Errors: 1.

Use Case 3: Recover Account (UC-03)
- Structural:
- Alternative flows handle exceptions: No base step. 1 error
- Errors: 1.

Use Case 4: Set Custom Spending Limits (UC-04)
- Structural:
- Alternative flows handle exceptions: No base step. 1 error
- Errors: 1.

Use Case 5: Manage Multiple Cryptocurrencies (UC-05)
- Structural:
- Alternative flows handle exceptions: No base step. 1 error
- Errors: 1.

Total I_err: (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1)/4: because it is simply about missing base steps in the alternative flow in 7 use cases.

Step 3: Compute Validity ( V )
[
V = 1 - (5/4)/52 = 0.9759

A full set of 10 use case specification was produced in the output of Task 5. It includes additional five use cases (Social Network Integration, Account Recovery, System Update, Password Reset, Account Lockout). The existing ones are similar, but not identical.

Structural Rules:
1. Required sections: Pre/postconditions, main flow, alternative flows.
2. Sequential numbering of steps.
3. Clear actor-system interaction format.

Intended Meaning Rules:
1. Pre/postconditions must be logical.
2. Main flow achieves the use case goal.
3. Alternative flows handle exceptions appropriately.
4. Steps describe meaning clearly.
