# Agent Configurations – Task Analyses

This repository contains textual analysis files for experiments on agent configurations in LLM-assisted software development. Although the files use the `.tex` extension (as they were created in LaTeX editors), they are not LaTeX compilable. They are plain text documents intended for review, reference, and integration into manuscripts.

## Purpose

Each file documents the analysis of a designated task in the evaluation of agent configurations. Specifically, every file contains results for:

- Three systems:  
  - TORS (Tour Reservation System)  
  - SWS (Smart Home System)  
  - FODS (Food Ordering and Delivery System)  

- Three agent configurations:  
  - Task-Specialist  
  - Phase-Specialist  
  - Process-Generalist  

The analyses typically include:  

- Task description and objectives  
- Evaluation methodology (validity criteria, correctness rules, etc.)  
- Results for TORS, SWS, and FODS under all three configurations  
- Comparative discussion and insights  

These files are meant for textual review and reference, not direct LaTeX compilation.

## Usage

- Open the `.tex` files in any text editor (e.g., VS Code, Overleaf, TeXShop) to read the analysis.  
- Copy or adapt sections into manuscripts or reports as needed.  
- Treat them as modular building blocks for documenting experimental results.
